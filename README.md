Hello and welcome to the ‘Game of Love’! As three students tasked with applying our newfound knowledge of Javascript, CSS, and HTML, we were looking to create an interactive webpage that would resonate with the masses. 
We settled on a page made up of our favorite characters from the hit HBO Drama ‘Game of Thrones’. This site is an interactive way for GOT fans to view character cards and comment on who they Loveth or Hateth.
The site is made up of a welcome screen that displays the Mother of Dragons, Daenerys Targaryen, and some key facts about her such as; Full Name, Title, Family, Image, and our favorite quote! We included three different kinds of event listeners in our javascript:

We included click events on the nav display at the top of the screen that allows the user to click on each character and display their relevant information
We included a form submission that allows the user to add comments about their favorite characters
We included a hover event that is activated when a user is about to add a comment, asking the user if they’re sure about their comment

There is also a second click event included for each character that allows the user to decide if they love or hate the character, with a relevant image displaying in response to their choice.
We hope you enjoy this page as much as we do.
“When you play the game of love, you win or you die. There is no middle ground.”
